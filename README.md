# Rael_DS
## Hi, I’m Rael

I’m interested in data science and data engineering, and I’m building a project-based portfolio focused on working with real-world data.

My work emphasizes:
- Writing clear, readable Python code
- Using SQL to explore and analyze structured data
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Understanding data before modeling it
- Documenting projects with clear explanations

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL basics)
- Data visualization (matplotlib)
- Jupyter / Kaggle Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

### 📂 Projects
This profile contains hands-on projects covering:
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Basic machine learning models
- Simple data pipelines

Each project includes a README explaining the goal, approach, and key takeaways.

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Strengthening Python and SQL fundamentals
- Building consistent, well-documented data projects
- Developing a strong understanding of data workflows
